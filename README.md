This project aimed to analyze and exploit a targeted machine through a structured approach to cybersecurity. Initially, two virtual machines were configured within the same internal network, and the target's IP address (10.38.1.111) was identified through an ARP scan. Then, using nmap, open ports and active service versions were discovered, including vsftpd, OpenSSH, and Apache. Analyzing the web interface on port 80 revealed a hidden BASE64-encoded hash, which suggested using a brute-force wordlist for further exploration. After identifying vulnera-bilities, an exploitation technique was applied through GRUB by modifying kernel parameters, allowing root access to the system. At this stage, the root password was changed, and directories were explored to retrieve the flags of success: flag{h4ck3r} and flag{1337}, confirming the suc-cessful completion of the project's objective.
